# two-player-card-game
- This is an automated simulation of a game which involves two players and a deck of cards.
- At the start, the deck is shuffled, and the cards are dealt equally to both players.
- Each turn consists of the following steps:
  - Both players reveal their top-most card.
  - The player with the higher valued card wins the round, taking both cards and adding them to their scoring pile, earning 1 point per card.
  - This process repeats until all cards have been played.
- The player with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner.
